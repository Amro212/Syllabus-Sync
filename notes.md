# Personal App Notes

## Consider changing the dashboard layout, with more relevant tab bar buttons (e.g. calendar button, view syllabus button, etc.)

## Profile icon on the top right for easy access

## Fix theme toggle (text is all squashed up)

## Make sure the loading bar is actually loading, along with the icon

# URGENT CHANGES

## AI is giving us back the wrong date (one day before the expected date)
